   * Write a regular expression that matches peopleâ€™s full names
   * Develop a regular expression that matches all gerunds within a text

4. POS Tagging
   * Use the first 10k tagged sentences from the Brown corpus to generate the components of a part-of-speech **hidden markov model**
5. Document Vectors
   * Explore how term-document matrices and weightings can be used for docu- ment classification, including **raw counts of terms, TF-IDF, TF-IDF variant**
6. RNN
   * Construct, manually, a RNN structure and associated weights
7. BRNN
